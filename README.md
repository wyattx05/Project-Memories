# Project-Memories
A way to download your Snapchat memories with the metadata and the captions applied and then view them in a Snapchat memories like interface. Relive your memories even if you can't pay to keep them on Snapchat!

# How-To

1. Download your snapchat memories data and you will get a Jason file
2. Run that Jason file though download_snapchat_memories.py
3. Run the downloaded folder of memories though apply_overlay_captions
4. Upload the folder of downloaded memories into Mmories_Interface.html

# Caution - This is in Beta!!
## You may notice it be slow or not fully work depedning on how many memories you have, I have been working on this for a while and this is the first public version. I plan to make this run a lot smoother in the future but I wanted to share what I have made so far!
